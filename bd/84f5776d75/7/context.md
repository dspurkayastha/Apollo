### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Hero Section — React Three Fiber 3D Scene

## Context

The CSS-only approach (now implemented) fixed the transform bug but the pages still look flat and lack real depth. The user wants:
1. **Better pages** — real 3D presence, not CSS pseudo-3D
2. **Bottom shadows** — currently missing entirely
3. **Scatter plot** — glass spheres arranged as data points on an XYZ coordinate graph showing a linear distribution with scatter
4. **Visible axes** — thin grey ...

### Prompt 2

kill and rerunn the dev server

### Prompt 4

This still doesnt look or feel the same as the mock up, the pages look same straight screen faces, now in shadow, and the graph has plastic marbles, instead of glass speheres of diff sizes, with varing scatter!

### Prompt 6

Lets take this edit by edit. Now the glass spehers look better, Lets split the 2 elements ie the pages and the graph as separate, give the graph , a hover motion instead of rotate, a fixed slant, deeper ground shadows, and a slight breathe effect

### Prompt 7

the graph is now clipped out of render frame, and has an end on view, hence z axis not visible. The glass spheres need better sparkle and brighter colors, they are the only source of color on the page. Bring the graph closer to the pages, rotate 25 deg on z axis, and - 20 deg on the y axis

### Prompt 9

make the z axis tilt 15 deg, and the y axis -30. change the colors of the spheres, and the breathe motion for the speres should be different for diff groups (diff colors in each group, grouped by motion not location) and also diff from the axes, which should have least but perceptibe motion. also deepen the shadow beneath the graph, and bring it closer to the graph, so that the graph feels closer to the 'floor'

### Prompt 10

check the arrangement of the pages , graphs, branding, and the type of the hero on the mockup. Our one feels very sparse and doesnt capture my edits

### Prompt 11

### Prompt 12

Do a gap analysis of the screenshot with the mockup

### Prompt 13

### Prompt 14

Make as close an approximation as you can, use whatver resources necessary. Blender etc whatever packages etc  will give the best and closest to the mockup. also additionally Make the Branding text and type of the hero better. Decrease the white space beneath the hero as well a bit

### Prompt 15

Plan for alternative 3D options and code templates, packages etc, which will give a better approximation to the mockup

### Prompt 16
