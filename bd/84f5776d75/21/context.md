## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

Go through the file /docs/Review.md, and find all  areas where my choice is reqd ,eg pricing, latex round trip options , etc etc and ask me questions to clarify those decision points [a previous chat went through and created a Decision_points.md in /docs/ , refer to that as well , but remember that file is not exhaustive.] Include your best choice recommendations for each decision point. Allow discussions for each question.

### Prompt 3

check again for Decision points.md

### Prompt 4

I know that the one time cost per thesis that students are paying is 18 to 20k. Keeping that in mind, what pricing model makes sense? what if a student doesnt have one time investements, and wants to pay over few months? better to allow EMI or do a monthly subscription? where to gate monthly? Professionals can pay more, and can be routed to the paper writing, and articles line of things in addition to theses, but if aiming for a PhD type of thesis, it will require much more model qouta, and henc...

### Prompt 5

Why would i give out theses in such low amount? wont it signal poor quality?    
     wouldnt it better placed at 75% of market? Also i would offer both, monthly, with minimum commitment and phase gating, and one time , no gate. Also addon shpould be scoped as you suggest.

### Prompt 7

I agree to the 14999/4999 model but i have a few quereies. 1. what is to stop a student who works on one thesis, completes it,then activetes another project and completes that with one licence? 2. Monthyl plan total cast needs to be margoinal;ly more so as to incentivise one time payments?

### Prompt 8

The licence binding to a thesis has some potential issues. what if the student enters the metadata wrong? or something changes in the synopsis in the middle? edge cases may arise. For the monthly premium I am happy with 10%

### Prompt 9

What does Ingest do ? how is different from what is happening now from end user perspective?

### Prompt 10

Splitting phase 6 is a good idea, but there are issues in the data analysis pipeline. Generation of dataset, with frontend displaying head for review, Adequate planning of REquired analysis on the basis of synopsis obectives , not just possible and feasible calculations as pper genertaed datasets (this is what is happening now), Adequate and appropriate figures generation needs to happen, and figures and tables number gating in final QC needs to be allowed and should happen

### Prompt 11

This is close but needs a crucial adjustment. Along with objectives, the ROL should also inform dataset generation for correct plausible numbers. Also not all analyses need to be picture perfect statitically significant.

### Prompt 12

Matching the analysis Plan is a good and appropriate idea, but a minimum gating is required. lets pin figures for results section at 5, and tables at 7 minimum for phase QC and final QC

### Prompt 13

Demographics doesnt need to be confined to a singular table, and a single figure. may be split logically.

### Prompt 14

The pdf download allowed after phase 6b is good, but download needs to be also allowed for the sandbox demo for students to see and share (marketing). Watermark should be "Apollo" in brand font (?Playfair Display)

### Prompt 15

Licensed individuals beyond phase 6b should not have DRAFT watermark across the page, that will create friction in getting approval. Suggest an alternate way to denote work in progress, (maybe very faint branding watermark, or a footer saying "Apollo" or?)

### Prompt 16

QC gates         â”‚ Hard ceiling: +15% of soft max; Hard floor: âˆ’15% of soft min is wrong, Hard floor is = soft minimum. Correct that.

### Prompt 17

yes, save it

### Prompt 18

now check the Review.md and Decisions.md files, and create a full plan to mitigate all issues based on the decisions taken. Ask any claryfying questions as necessary. Ask for any installs as necessary. Install upstash Redis mcp for that job, and tell me what is required from me. Think ultra hard to create the plan, audit and find all lacunae in your plan and present the final audited fixed plan to me . Ensure to include a step 0 in the plan to Write down the plan as /docs/Mitigation_plan.md

### Prompt 19

Upstash, inngest, R2 all accounts exist, but i need help from you to supply the tokens, emails, etc etc Ask for  specific stuff and I shall provide. Provide assistance in terms of what creds to get where
