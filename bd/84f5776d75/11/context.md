### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# LaTeX-to-Tiptap Converter + AI Review Pass

## Context

AI generates pure LaTeX for each thesis phase. Currently `rich_content_json` stays null after generation, so the Rich Text editor shows a blank doc. The user wants:
1. AI-generated LaTeX auto-converted to Tiptap JSON so the Rich Text editor works immediately
2. User edits in Rich Text (primary experience), converted back to LaTeX on save (already works via `tiptapToLatex()`)
3. AI review pass before approval...

### Prompt 2

### Prompt 6

approve anyway, doesnt advance to next phase , the save and compile buttons keep recompiling the original latex i feel, whatever the ai has written, and the bibtex entries, after user approval, should be formed to a introduction.tex and added to .bib respectively. THe main.tex neds to have /include intr.tex after that, and then compile should run> Use proper logic, dont work scoped in, get bigger pic first. align to PLAN, local cli version of workflow. and then fix this issue
