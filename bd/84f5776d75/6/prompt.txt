Implement the following plan:

# Hero Section Rewrite — Exact Mockup Match

## Context

The current hero has three critical problems vs the reference mockup:
1. **Papers look like flat UI cards** — rounded corners, landscape orientation, uniform grey lines, weak shadows
2. **Spheres look like flat coloured circles** — need true 3D glass with specular highlights and depth
3. **Chart card shouldn't exist** — the mockup has ONLY papers + spheres. No separate chart element.

The mockup's visual identity is sold by **lighting and shadows**: a directional light from upper-left creates long soft shadows on the pages and bright specular highlights on the spheres.

## Files to Modify (2 files)

| # | File | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `apps/web/app/globals.css` | Update `.paper-shadow`, fix `float-thesis` keyframe |
| 2 | `apps/web/components/landing/hero-section.tsx` | Full rewrite of right zone |

## Detailed Visual Analysis of Mockup

### Papers (3 scattered thesis pages — with natural folds/curls)

| Property | Mockup | Current (broken) |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Shape | **Tall portrait** (~220×340px), sharp corners (2px radius) | Landscape-ish cards, `rounded-xl` |
| Content | Dense paragraph-like text: title line + grouped line blocks separated by whitespace gaps, looks like real paragraphs | Single list of uniform grey lines |
| Shadows | **Deep directional** — shifted down-right (12px, 30px), large blur (60px), 20%+ opacity. This is the #1 visual seller | Weak centered shadow |
| 3D tilt | Heavy rotation -15° to +5° | Similar range but less dramatic because pages are short |
| Stacking | Pages overlap significantly, centre page on top | OK but pages too short to overlap well |
| **Paper curl/fold** | Pages are NOT flat — they have natural bends and rolling like real paper caught mid-air. One page curls at the bottom, another has a slight roll at the edge, some appear to bend slightly in the middle | Completely flat rectangles |

#### CSS technique for paper curls/folds
Real paper curling can be simulated with multiple CSS techniques combined:
1. **Page curl at corner** — a pseudo-element (`::after`) with a gradient fold triangle + matching shadow
2. **Subtle body warp** — CSS `perspective` + `rotateX`/`rotateY` on the page to make it appear to tilt away from the viewer
3. **Edge roll** — A thin strip along one edge that uses a gradient from white to slightly darker (simulating paper rolling over)
4. **Shadow that follows the curl** — `filter: drop-shadow()` on the parent (not `box-shadow`) so the shadow follows the non-rectangular silhouette created by the curl
5. **Multiple box-shadow layers** — The main page shadow + a separate darker contact shadow near the curl point

### Glass Spheres (8-12 spheres)

| Property | Mockup | Current (broken) |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| 3D effect | **Radial gradient with specular highlight** — bright white spot at ~30% 25% of sphere, base colour in middle, darker at edges | Flat `bg-gradient-to-br` — looks like a coloured disc |
| CSS technique | `radial-gradient(circle at 30% 25%, white-highlight, transparent, base-color, dark-edge)` | Linear gradient |
| Sizes | Biggest ~90px, range down to 15px | Max 80px, range too narrow |
| Clustering | Grape-like tight bunch, spheres genuinely overlap | Spread too far apart |
| Position | Right of pages, partially overlapping rightmost page edge | Too far right, isolated |

### Chart Card
**Does not exist in mockup.** Remove entirely.

## Implementation

### 1. `globals.css` — Update shadows, curls, float-thesis

**`.paper-page`** — uses `filter: drop-shadow()` so shadow follows rotated/curled shape:
```css
.paper-page {
  filter: drop-shadow(10px 25px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.22))
          drop-shadow(4px 10px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.10));
}
```

**`.paper-shadow`** — keep as supplemental contact shadow:
```css
.paper-shadow {
  box-shadow:
    8px 20px 40px -10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.18),
    3px 8px 16px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.10);
}
```

**`.paper-curl-corner`** — bottom-right corner fold:
```css
.paper-curl-corner {
  position: relative;
}
.paper-curl-corner::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 45px;
  height: 45px;
  background: linear-gradient(225deg, #E0E0E0 0%, #EEEEEE 40%, white 50%, transparent 50%);
  border-radius: 0 0 3px 0;
  box-shadow: -3px -3px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
}
```

**`.paper-curl-bottom`** — subtle bottom edge darkening (roll):
```css
.paper-curl-bottom::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  height: 8px;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04));
  border-radius: 0 0 3px 3px;
}
```

**`.paper-curl-side`** — right edge shadow strip (lift):
```css
.paper-curl-side::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 8px;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05));
  border-radius: 0 3px 3px 0;
}
```

**`@keyframes float-thesis`** — Y-only float (rotation stays from inline transform):
```css
@keyframes float-thesis {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); }
  50% { transform: translateY(-14px); }
}
```

### 2. `hero-section.tsx` — Rewrite right zone

#### Remove
- `GlassChart` component and its entire motion.div — **deleted**
- Current `TextLines` component — replaced with `ParagraphBlock`

#### New: `ParagraphBlock` component
Simulates a real paragraph — 3-5 lines of varying width, thin (`h-[1.5px]`), with natural variation:
```tsx
function ParagraphBlock({ widths }: { widths: string[] }) {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-[4px]">
      {widths.map((w, i) => (
        <div key={i} className="h-[1.5px] rounded-full bg-[#C8C8C8]" style={{ width: w }} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### New: `ThesisPage` component
A tall portrait page that looks like actual paper **with natural folds/curls**:

**Base structure:**
- Size: fixed width + tall aspect. Example: `w-[230px]` with tall content making it ~320px+
- Corners: `rounded-[3px]` — almost sharp, like real paper
- Colour: `bg-white`
- Internal content: title line (`h-[2.5px] w-[50%] bg-[#B0B0B0]`) + 3 ParagraphBlocks with `gap-[12px]`
- Outer wrapper uses `filter: drop-shadow(...)` instead of `box-shadow` — so shadow follows the curled silhouette

**Paper curl/fold effects (3 variants, one per page):**

**Variant A — bottom-right corner curl:**
- `::after` pseudo-element: positioned `absolute bottom-0 right-0`, size ~40×40px
- Background: `linear-gradient(225deg, #E8E8E8 0%, #F5F5F5 45%, transparent 50%)` — simulates folded-back paper
- The main page gets `border-bottom-right-radius: 40px` where the curl is, OR clip-path to cut the corner
- Shadow under the curl: a small `box-shadow` on the pseudo-element shifted left-up

**Variant B — bottom edge roll (gentle wave):**
- A thin `::after` strip along the bottom: `h-[6px]`, full width
- Background: `linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent, rgba(0,0,0,0.04))` — subtle darkening simulating paper rolling
- Combined with slight `rotateX(2deg)` on the page to make it look like the bottom is lifting toward the viewer

**Variant C — side edge lift:**
- Right edge appears to lift: achieved by combining `rotateY(-4deg)` with the parent perspective
- A thin shadow gradient along the right edge: `linear-gradient(to right, transparent 90%, rgba(0,0,0,0.04))`
- This makes the page appear to curl away at the right edge

**Shadow strategy for all pages:**
- **Primary**: `filter: drop-shadow(10px 25px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.20))` on the outer container — follows the rotated shape
- **Contact shadow**: additional `box-shadow: 5px 15px 20px -5px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)` for a tighter shadow near the page
- Using `filter: drop-shadow` rather than `box-shadow` alone is critical — `box-shadow` creates a rectangular shadow regardless of rotation, while `drop-shadow` follows the actual rendered shape

#### Three pages layout (absolute positioned in right zone):

```
Page A (back-left, corner curl):
  - rotate: -15deg
  - position: left: 4%, top: 10%
  - width: 230px
  - z-index: 1
  - animationDelay: 0s
  - Curl: bottom-right corner fold
  - Lines: title + three 4-line paragraphs

Page B (centre-front, bottom roll, on top):
  - rotate: -6deg, rotateX: 2deg (subtle lift)
  - position: left: 16%, top: 0%
  - width: 250px
  - z-index: 3
  - animationDelay: 1.5s
  - Curl: bottom edge roll
  - Lines: title + three 5-line paragraphs

Page C (right-lean, side lift):
  - rotate: 5deg, rotateY: -3deg
  - position: left: 32%, top: 16%
  - width: 210px
  - z-index: 2
  - animationDelay: 3s
  - Curl: right edge lift
  - Lines: title + two 4-line paragraphs
```

#### New: `GlassSphere` component
The critical 3D glass effect via **radial gradient with specular highlight**:
```tsx
function GlassSphere({ size, baseColor, darkColor, top, left, delay, opacity = 1 }: {
  size: number;
  baseColor: string;   // e.g. "122,140,102" — RGB values
  darkColor: string;    // e.g. "80,100,60"
  top: number;
  left: number;
  delay: string;
  opacity?: number;
}) {
  return (
    <div
      className="absolute rounded-full border border-white/25 animate-float-sphere"
      style={{
        width: size,
        height: size,
        top,
        left,
        animationDelay: delay,
        opacity,
        background: `radial-gradient(circle at 30% 25%,
          rgba(255,255,255,0.7) 0%,
          rgba(255,255,255,0.15) 28%,
          rgba(${baseColor}, 0.85) 60%,
          rgba(${darkColor}, 0.95) 100%)`,
        boxShadow: `inset 0 -4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08),
                     0 4px 16px -4px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)`,
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

The `radial-gradient(circle at 30% 25%, ...)` places a bright white specular highlight in the upper-left where the light hits, then fades through transparent into the sphere's base colour, with a darker edge at the bottom-right. This creates the 3D glass illusion.

#### Sphere Cluster — 10 spheres
All within a `relative` container positioned at `right: -2%, top: 3%, z-index: 4`:

```
 #  Size  Top  Left  Base RGB         Dark RGB         Delay
 1   90    0    30   122,140,102      80,100,60        0s      ← big sage
 2   72    55   110  196,147,90       160,110,55       0.8s    ← big amber
 3   62    100  10   232,220,200      200,185,160      1.4s    ← large cream
 4   50    25   130  168,184,148      130,150,110      1.2s    ← med sage
 5   42    135  90   140,160,120      100,120,80       0.6s    ← med olive
 6   30    155  45   58,58,58         30,30,30         2.0s    ← sm charcoal
 7   26    75   0    196,147,90       160,110,55       2.4s    ← sm amber
 8   34    175  120  232,220,200      200,185,160      1.6s    ← sm cream
 9   20    95   160  122,140,102      80,100,60        1.8s    ← tiny sage
10   16    190  70   240,230,214      210,200,180      0.4s    ← tiny cream
```

Container size: `w-[200px] h-[240px]`

#### Right zone container
```tsx
<div className="relative hidden h-[560px] w-full lg:col-span-7 lg:block"
     style={{ perspective: "1200px" }}>
```

The `perspective: 1200px` on the parent makes the child rotations look 3D rather than just skewed.

#### Motion entrances (staggered)
- Pages: delay 0.5s, 0.65s, 0.8s — fade in + scale 0.88→1 + y: 40→0
- Spheres: delay 0.9s — fade in + scale 0.7→1
- (No chart — removed)

## Verification

1. `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — zero errors
2. Visual: pages are tall portrait shapes with sharp corners, dense paragraph-like content
3. Visual: pages have deep directional shadows shifted down-right
4. Visual: spheres have bright white specular highlight in upper-left, dark edge bottom-right = 3D glass
5. Visual: no chart card present — only papers and spheres
6. Visual: spheres cluster tightly, overlapping each other and the rightmost page edge
7. Visual: entire composition forms one cohesive cluster, not separate groups
