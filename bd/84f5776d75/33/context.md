### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Phase 11: Cleanup and Testing â€” Implementation Plan

## Context

Phase 11 is the final pre-launch phase. It addresses 16 items from `Mitigation_plan.md` (items 11.1â€“11.16) covering lint cleanup, dead code removal, bug fixes, missing RLS policies, performance improvements, and low-severity security items. 5 items are already resolved (dictionary SSOT, spelling-fix moot, migrations tracked, canAdvancePhase not dead, PWA exists). 14 items require work across ~25...

<result>All six lint fixes are complete. Here is a summary of each change:

1. **`/Users/devs/Downloads/Apollo/apps/web/components/editor/latex-editor.tsx`** (line 81) -- Added an `eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` comment with an explanation: the `useEffect` intentionally has no dependency array because CodeMirror lazily creates its `view` ...

<result>All six fixes verified. Here is a summary of what was changed:

---

**Fix 1** -- `/Users/devs/Downloads/Apollo/apps/web/app/(dashboard)/projects/[id]/project-workspace.tsx` line 174
Removed the unused `// eslint-disable-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` comment. The dependency array already lists all used dependencies, so the directive was unnecessary....

<result>Good. The `_match` was renamed to `_` which is the conventional way to name an unused loop variable in TypeScript.

Here is a summary of all fixes applied:

---

**1. `/Users/devs/Downloads/Apollo/apps/web/components/project/export-menu.tsx`** -- Removed unused `currentPhase` parameter

- Removed `currentPhase: number` from `ExportMenuProps` interface (...

### Prompt 5

NOw realign to the Review ,Deiscussion, Mitigation_plan, Mitigation_implementation.md files in /docs/ and check all the changes made in phase 11 for consistency, correctness, errors , logical fallacies, redundancies and other logic issues. Think ultra hard

### Prompt 13

we have the DEPLOYMENT.md file now ready. audit it for any mistakes . its in /docs/

### Prompt 14

r2 bucket is ccalled apollo-files, i already own sciscribessolutions.com which is the parent legal entity, hence i chose apollo.sciscribesolutions.com, check my actual .env.local for env variables. then fix all issues

### Prompt 15

so you are sure that this deployment.md file now contains all guidelines to deploy a production version? none of the ports/ip addresses etc are local hosts? and followign this line by line will deploy a production version?

### Prompt 16

### Prompt 19

Now check the Deployment.md file in /docs/ Check how much if it can you do independently . At each step, give me step by step instructions to achieve what is required from my end (eg prvisioning a vps etc) , and continue when you have checked and found step as complete. Create a deployment implementation file in /docs, which will contain completion reports of each step for audit trail, and lessons learnt, and deferred or todo items. While the deployment.md file is the guide, do not assume that s...
