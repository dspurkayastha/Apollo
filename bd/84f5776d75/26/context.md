# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Phase 4: Editor Migration (CodeMirror 6) â€” Implementation Plan

## Context

**Problem**: The Tiptap/Novel rich text editor destroys LaTeX constructs during the round-trip conversion. This is the P0 content quality issue identified in REVIEW.md:

- **C1**: `$p < 0.05$` (inline math) â†’ `\$p < 0.05\$` (literal dollar signs, not math mode)
- **C2**: `\footnote{}`, `\url{}`, `\textsuperscript{}` â†’ garbled (backslash consumed as plain text)
- **C3**: `\label{}` â...

### Prompt 2

now check all the chnages made against the review, decisions, mitigation plan and mitigation implementation files, for alignment. Also check all changes made for proper logical correctness for the project. Think ultra hard

### Prompt 3

### Prompt 4

fill up mitigation implementation file with phase 4 completiion report

### Prompt 5

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation to capture all important details.

1. The user provided a detailed Phase 4 implementation plan for migrating from Tiptap/Novel rich text editor to CodeMirror 6 as the sole editor in the Apollo project.

2. I implemented the entire Phase 4 plan step by step:
   - Step 0: Fixed CI test poll...

### Prompt 6

find the phase 4 completion reports, and check the changes made against the Review.md, Decisions.md, Mitigation_plan.md and Mitigation_implementation.md for alignment. Also check the changes made for proper logic for this project. Think ultra hard and find any errors of code or logic, and debug. Then populate the Mitigation_implementation.md with phase 4 completion report

### Prompt 7

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation to capture all important details.

1. This conversation is a continuation of a previous session where the entire Phase 4: Editor Migration (CodeMirror 6) was implemented. The previous session implemented all 12 steps of the plan.

2. The user's message in this session asks to:
   - Find t...

### Prompt 8

<task-notification>
<task-id>a4e01ef</task-id>
<status>completed</status>
<summary>Agent "Read review and mitigation docs" completed</summary>
<result>Here are the complete contents of all three files:

## File 1: /Users/devs/Downloads/Apollo/docs/Mitigation_implementation.md

This is a comprehensive log documenting the implementation status of all mitigation work across 3 phases:

**Phase 1: Critical Safety** (COMPLETE, commit b852cec)
- Fixed CI-blocking lint error, IDOR vulnerabilities, role ...

### Prompt 9

run lint check as well

### Prompt 10

any supabase migrations to push left?

### Prompt 11

now commit and push

### Prompt 12

now re align to the Review.md, Decisions.md, Mitigation_plan.md, Mitigation_implementation.md files. Check these files throughly (especially the deferred items listed in the Mitigation_implementation.md for items deferred to Phase 5. Then proceed to create a full proof plan which is code wise and logically correct for execution of Phase 5. For the system prompts, be as detailed and specific as possible. Add proper inputs, expected deliverable(s), constraints, etc as a well designed system prompt...

### Prompt 13

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation to capture all important details.

1. This conversation is a continuation of TWO previous sessions. The first session implemented all of Phase 4 (Editor Migration to CodeMirror 6). The second session (summarized at the start) performed the Phase 4 completion audit, found bugs, and wrote t...
