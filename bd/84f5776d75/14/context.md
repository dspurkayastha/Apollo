### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Premium Feature Cards — Fix Grid + Hover

## Context

The feature cards in `features-section.tsx` have three problems:

1. **Broken bento grid**: Framer Motion `y` offsets (`y: -32` for middle column) displace cards from their CSS grid cells, breaking alignment. The original CSS `lg:-translate-y-8` worked because CSS transforms don't affect grid layout, but Framer Motion's inline `transform` overwrites it.

2. **Invisible sage tint**: The `bg-[#8B9D77]/20...

### Prompt 2

place the pages and the grpah and the shadows slightly higher up inside the 3d container. about 10%.

### Prompt 3

The sage glow on the cards is too diffuse, and too sublime and I feel it should be a bit off center eg hugging the edge from where the cursor is placed with resoect to the center of the card. Think ultra hard and plan properly

### Prompt 4

increase the center opacity for sage color to 15%, then 12% at 20% radius, then 6% at 40% radius, and by 80% radius becomes transparent

### Prompt 5

Now do this same thing for the price cards, but instead of sage use an amber color

### Prompt 6

I dont want to remove the whileover scale animation!, only add the amber glow with cursor!

### Prompt 7

The Most Popular pill is split and only the lower half is visible,

### Prompt 8

The 3 pages in the 3d container dont have enough seoparation. The edges are not discernable, and there is no shadow between them. Also the brightness of the pages is not good or up to the mark, should increase a bit more. Think ultra hard for a fix

### Prompt 9

For these cards , do the same glow as the service cards, price cards. The color for these should be lilac
