PART III: VANCOUVER CITATION SYSTEM

SSUHS mandates the **Vancouver citation style** (also known as ICMJE
style). This is the standard for medical and biomedical publications
worldwide.

3.1 In-Text Citation Rules

Numbering System

-   Citations are numbered consecutively in the order they first appear
    in the text

-   Use Arabic numerals in square brackets: \[1\], \[2\], \[3\]

-   The same number is used for subsequent citations of the same source

-   Multiple citations are separated by commas: \[1,3,5\] or as ranges:
    \[1-5\]

Placement Rules

-   Place citation numbers AFTER punctuation (periods, commas)

-   Numbers appear in superscript OR in square brackets at baseline
    (SSUHS accepts both)

-   When citing at end of sentence: \"\...as reported previously.\[1\]\"
    or \"\...as reported previously.Â¹\"

Examples of In-Text Citations

> **Single source:** \"Cirrhosis affects liver function
> significantly.\[1\]\"
>
> **Multiple sources:** \"Several studies have confirmed this
> finding.\[2,4,7\]\"
>
> **Consecutive sources:** \"As demonstrated in previous
> research.\[3-6\]\"
>
> **Author mention:** \"According to Sharma et al.\[8\], the
> prevalence\...\"

3.2 Reference List (Bibliography) Formatting

-   List references in numerical order (order of first citation)

-   Use standard journal abbreviations (Index Medicus/MEDLINE style)

-   Include DOI when available

-   List up to 6 authors; if more than 6, list first 6 followed by \"et
    al.\"

3.3 Citation Examples by Source Type

PART IV: TABLES, FIGURES, AND DATA PRESENTATION

4.1 Tables

1.  Number tables sequentially using Arabic numerals (Table 1, Table 2,
    etc.)

2.  Place table number and title ABOVE the table

3.  Title should be descriptive and concise

4.  Include units of measurement in column headers

5.  Use horizontal lines only (top, below header, bottom) - avoid
    vertical lines

6.  Legends and footnotes go BELOW the table in 10pt font

7.  Every table must be referenced in the text before it appears

8.  Insert tables as close as possible to the text that refers to them

4.2 Figures and Images

1.  Number figures sequentially (Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.) - separate
    from tables

2.  Place figure number and caption BELOW the figure

3.  Use high resolution images (minimum 300 DPI for print)

4.  Scan photographs and images at good resolution

5.  De-identify all patient images (remove DICOM headers, patient
    details)

6.  Include scale bars for microscopy images

7.  Explain all abbreviations and symbols in the legend

4.3 Statistical Presentation

-   **P-values:** Report exact values (p=0.032), use p\<0.001 for very
    small values

-   **Confidence Intervals:** Report as 95% CI (lower-upper) or \[lower,
    upper\]

-   **Continuous data:** Mean Â± SD (normal distribution) or Median (IQR)
    (skewed)

-   **Categorical data:** n (%) format

-   **Effect sizes:** Include OR, RR, HR with confidence intervals

PART V: MEDICAL WRITING CONVENTIONS

5.1 Drug Nomenclature

-   Use generic (nonproprietary) names in lowercase throughout

-   Brand names (if necessary) in parentheses on first mention only,
    capitalised

-   **Example:** \"Patients received metformin (Glucophage) 500 mg twice
    daily.\"

5.2 Abbreviations

1.  Define all abbreviations at first use in each major section

2.  Apply the \"three-use rule\" - only abbreviate terms appearing three
    or more times

3.  Standard abbreviations (MRI, CT, ECG, DNA, HIV) need no definition

4.  List all abbreviations in the \"List of Abbreviations\" section

5.  Do not begin sentences with abbreviations

5.3 Numbers and Units

-   Spell out numbers one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above

-   Always use numerals with units: 5 mg, 3 ml, 7 days

-   Never begin a sentence with a numeral - spell it out or restructure

-   Use SI units as the primary system
