# Sprint 2 Implementation Plan

## Context

Sprint 1 delivered the scaffolding: auth (Clerk), DB (15 migrations, 13 tables, RLS), project CRUD, licence management, 5-step setup wizard, R2 upload, landing page, and CI pipeline. Sprint 1-2 combined acceptance criteria require 4 remaining items that Sprint 2 must deliver:

1. **AI synopsis parsing** — Claude API integration (regex parser exists, no AI)
2. **Compiled title page PDF** — LaTeX compilation pipeline (R...

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze the conversation:

1. User provided a detailed Sprint 2 implementation plan with 8 work packages (WP1-WP8) for the Apollo thesis generation platform.

2. I explored the codebase extensively to understand existing patterns:
   - Read API routes, auth, errors, types, validation schemas
   - Read templates (...
