### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Enable Sentry Error Monitoring

## Context

Production errors are invisible — the "Failed to fix LaTeX errors" 404 was only caught because the user happened to screenshot the console. Sentry is already 80% configured (`@sentry/nextjs ^10.38.0` installed, 3 config files with PII scrubbing, `withSentryConfig` in `next.config.ts` gated on `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`). We just need to wire the last 4 gaps so that setting the DSN env var "turns on" full error capture.

### Prompt 18

but even after the fix with Ai is run, and the prepended text is deleted and content saved, the latex error returns again! (the whole exercise becomes futile. Also to acoid compile conflicts, the compile button should remain greyed out or show a spinning circle indicator whnever a compile is running.
