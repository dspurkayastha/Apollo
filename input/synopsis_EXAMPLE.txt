A CLINICAL STUDY ON POST ERCP BILIARY STONE MANAGEMENT IN A TERTIARY CARE CENTRE
INTRODUCTION
Biliary stone disease is responsible for about 1.8 million ambulatory care visits and more than
700 000 surgeries yearly in the United States.â€ Gallstone disease is the second most common
reason for hospital admissions (with an estimated cost of US$5.8 billion annually), although only
15% of people with gallstones have related symptoms.*~ One complication is the occurrence of
stones in the common bile duct++
Stones in the common bile duct most commonly result from the passage of gallstones through
the cystic duct into the common bile duct. Less frequently, they may originate in the common
bile duct itself. Stones in the common bile duct can cause biliary obstruction, cholangitis,
pancreatitis, or secondary biliary cirrhosis in patients who have had the stones for a long time.
More than 1 in 10 patients (10%-18%) undergoing cholecystectomy for gallstones have
concomitant common bile duct stones,* and up to 3.8% have symptoms related to common bile
duct stones during the first year after cholecystectomyâ€œ
There are controversies regarding timing of laparoscopic cholecystectomy after ERCP , ERCP
intervention of biliary stone causes inflammatory responses .It may cause difficulties in
subsequent laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy with longer operation time , operator
conversion rates , increased operative time , blood loss etc . These inflammatory responses
increases with time after ERCP and may take 4-6 weeks to resolve .
From 10 % to 18 % of patients undergoing Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC) for gallbladder
stones have synchronous CBD stones [2, 3]. These should be diagnosed and treated even if
asymptomatic [4]. Prior to the development of minimally invasive surgery, when the surgical
approach to CBD stones consisted of choledocholithotomy by open surgery, there was
considerable morbidity (11-14 %) [5]. With the advent of endoscopic and laparoscopic
techniques, In majority CBD stones were removed preoperatively by ERCP though a novel
approach for bile duct stone removal has its limitations .It many cause cholangitis , acute
pancreatitis , duodenal injury ete, it is not also applicable in all cases of biliary stones [6]. With
refinements in laparoscopic techniques and experience many centers have started performing
laparoscopic CBD exploration with acceptable results and complications [7]. Simultaneous or
single-stage laparoscopic cholecystectomy and CBD exploration has not yet become standard
management. There are only a few randomized trials available comparing the single stage with
sequential management (ERCP followed by LC) of patients with concomitant gallstones and CBD
stones [8, 9]. Combined single stage laparoendoscopic approach to the management of
choledocholithiasis has also been advocated by established centres [1, 10] with results
comparable to sequential management and single stage total laparoscopic exploration.
ERCP may not be successful in all cases due to several reasons ,In those cases CBD stones are to
be dealt during cholecystectomy , which may laparoscopic /open procedure.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE

Literature search was performed using online search engines, Google, Pubmed, the online
Springer link library and the Cochrane Database Systematic Review. Textbooks of
gastrointestinal surgery and laparoscopy were also reviewed. Review articles, prospective and
retrospective studies which detailed or compared the various treatment strategies for CBD
stones were selected and analyzed. Case reports were not reviewed for the article.

Several studies have compared a â€œlaparoscopic- firstâ€ approach to the management of CBD
stones with the more commonly used â€œsequential treatmentâ€ i.e. endoscopic extraction followed
by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic CBD exploration involves either transcystic
approach (fluoroscopy guided or choledochoscopy) or laparoscopic choledochotomy and stone
extraction.

1) The treatment of known CBD stonesâ€”preoperative EST followed by LC vs. LCBDE was
compared in two randomized control trials [8, 9]. The results of the two approaches are
similar, although the length of hospital stay is shorter with LCBDE in the Cuscheiri, et al.
study, The weakness inherent in these studies is that they fail to include the morbidity of
negative preoperative ERCP.

2)Costi et al. [2] performed a case-control study comparing a single stage laparoscopic
approach with sequential treatment. No difference emerged concerning early and late
complications, mortality, or laparotomies needed to accomplish cholecystectomy and CBD
clearance. The postoperative hospital stay was shorter in the single stage group. In this group,
only 22 patients underwent choledochotomy (45 %), and 15 patients underwent perioperative
ERCP (30 %). Conversions decreased with practice. After choledochotomy, an increasing number
of patients underwent primary closure of the CBD (with no biliary drain), without
complications. They came to the conclusion that a single stage laparoscopic approach to
gallbladder/CBD tones is safe and feasible. It may allow the majority of surgeons to avoid
excessively difficult/dangerous surgical procedures as well as unnecessary ERCPs in most cases.
A tendency toward a lower incidence of conversions and a rarer use of biliary drains may lead to,
an improved immediate outcome for patients undergoing a single stage approach.

3)Bansal et al. [6] conducted a prospective randomized trial which compared single stage
laparoscopic treatment with sequential treatment of CBD stones. 15 patients were randomized
to each group and the two groups had comparable demographic and clinical profile. In group I
there was a success rate of 93.5 % in comparison with 86.7 % in group II (p = 0.32, Fisher's exact
test). The complications were similar in the two groups. The results showed equivalent success
rate in terms of morbidity and hospital stay. They concluded that laparoscopic approach seems
to be favorable because of the smaller number of procedures and hospital visits.

4)Chander et al. [13] operated on 150 patients with documented CBD stones. Of these, 4
patients underwent laparoscopic transcystic exploration of CBD and 146 patients had their CBD
stones removed through the laparoscopic transcholedochal route. There were 34 men and 116
women patients with age ranging from 15 to 72 years. The mean size of the CBD on ultrasound
was 11.7 + 3.7 mm and on MRCP 13.8 + 4.7 mm. The number of stones extracted varied from 1 to
70 and the size of the extracted stones from 5 to 30 mm. The average duration of surgery was
139.9 + 26.3 min and the mean intraoperative blood loss was 103.4 + 85.9 ml. There were 6
conversions to open procedures, 1 postoperative death (0.7 %), and 23 patients (15 %) had
nonfatal postoperative complications. Three patients had retained stones (2 %) and one
developed recurrent stone (0.7 %). In their opinion LCBDE when performed by an experienced

surgeon results in no additional morbidity or mortality as compared to open surgery, with
excellent success rates (98 % in this series), and thus specially benefits the subgroup of patients
with multiple, large, impacted stones in a dilated CBD who were traditionally subjected to open
exploration.

5)Ahmed et al. [10] compared preoperative versus intraoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy
for management of CBD stones. 198 patients diagnosed preoperatively with gallbladder and CBD
stones were eligible. They were randomly divided into two groups: Preoperative endoscopic
Sphincterotomy (PEST)/LC group (n = 100) and LC/Intraoperative endoscopic Sphincterotomy
(1OEST) group (n = 98). The operative duration, surgical success rate, number of stone extracted,
postoperative complications, retained common bile duct stones, and postoperative lengths of
stay were compared prospectively. There were no statistically significant differences in surgical
time, surgical success rate, CBD diameter, stone size, or stone number between the two groups.
The success rate was 95.3 % and 97.8 % for PEST/LC and LC/IOEST, respectively. There were no
significant difference in postoperative retained stones, surgical time, and complications, but the
total hospital stay was significantly shorter in the LC/IOEST group. They concluded that
PEST/LC and LC/1OEST are both good options for dealing with preoperatively diagnosed CBDS,
but when there is enough experience and facilities, LC/IOEST, as a single-stage treatment, should
be preferable.

6) Hong et al. [12] compared laparoscopic cholecystectomy combined with intraoperative
endoscopic sphincterotomy with laparoscopic CBD exploration. For this study, 234 patients with
cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by preoperative B-ultrasonography and
intraoperative cholangiogram were divided at random into an LC-LCBDE group (141cases) and
an LC-IOEST group (93 cases). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of
surgical time, surgical success rate, number of stone extractions, postoperative complications,
retained common bile duct stones, postoperative length of stay, and hospital charge. It was
concluded that both LC-IOEST and LC-LCBDE were shown to be safe, effective, minimally
invasive treatments for concomitant gallbladder and CBD stones.

7) Greca et al. [1] reviewed the simultaneous laparoendoscopic rendezvous(RV) for the
treatment of CBD stones with single stage totally laparoscopic (TL) treatment and sequential
treatments (ST). Data was collected from 27 papers concerning 795 patients. The overall
effectiveness of RV was 92.3 %. The morbidity rate was 5.1 %, and the mortality rate was

0.37 %. Almost all the authors were satisfied with the procedure. The authorsâ€™ comparison to ST
and TL showed that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages mostly related to logistical
problems. They were of the view that the results are at least comparable with those of the other
available approaches. The effectiveness of RV is greater with reciprocal implementation of
surgical and endoscopic procedures. The morbidity and the risk of iatrogenic damage seem
lower than with ERCP-ES and the risk of residual stones lower than with TL treatment. The RV
procedure is safe and can sometimes be the preferable option, but collaboration between
surgeon and endoscopist is mandatory.
