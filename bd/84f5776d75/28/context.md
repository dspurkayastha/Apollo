### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Phase 6: Phase 6a/6b Restructure and Analysis Pipeline — Implementation Plan

## Context

**Problem**: Phase 6 (Results) is monolithic — students can generate the Results chapter without uploading a dataset or running analyses. There is no AI-driven analysis planning, no figure/table QC gates, no figure download/preview, no subfigure support, and analysis recommendations are ephemeral (not persisted). The R Plumber analysis pipeline works but lacks integratio...

### Prompt 2

NOw realign to the Review ,Deiscussion, Mitigation_plan, Mitigation_implementation.md files in /docs/ and check all the changes made in phase 6 for consistency, correctness, errors , logical fallacies, redundancies and other logic issues. Think ultra hard

### Prompt 3

Analysis:
Let me carefully analyze the entire conversation chronologically:

**Message 1 (User):** The user provides a detailed implementation plan for "Phase 6: Phase 6a/6b Restructure and Analysis Pipeline" with 14 steps. This is a comprehensive plan to split Phase 6 into sub-phases (6a for Dataset + Analysis Planning, 6b for Results), add AI-...

### Prompt 5

commit this, push and watch the CI

### Prompt 6

do a git diff

### Prompt 7

now start on phase 7. realign to the Review ,Deiscussion, Mitigation_plan, Mitigation_implementation.md files and create the plan for implementation of phase 7. While creating the plan, be sure to check for logical errors, possible code errors etc. Opt for proper fixes, never stopgap measures
