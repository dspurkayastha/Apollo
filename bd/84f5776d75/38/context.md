### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Enable Sentry Error Monitoring

## Context

Production errors are invisible — the "Failed to fix LaTeX errors" 404 was only caught because the user happened to screenshot the console. Sentry is already 80% configured (`@sentry/nextjs ^10.38.0` installed, 3 config files with PII scrubbing, `withSentryConfig` in `next.config.ts` gated on `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`). We just need to wire the last 4 gaps so that setting the DSN env var "turns on" full error capture.
