Implement the following plan:

# Fix "Fix with AI" — Targeted Line-Number-Based LaTeX Fixing

## Context

The "Fix with AI" button doesn't actually work reliably. The root cause is that the fix-latex route sends the **entire section content** (~2000-5000 lines) to Haiku with a vague error string like `"Compilation failed: ! Missing $ inserted; ! Undefined control sequence"`, and asks it to rewrite the **complete chapter**. This is:

- **Wasteful**: ~10,000 lines of AI I/O per fix
- **Error-prone**: Haiku adds preamble, changes content, or loses parts of the document
- **Imprecise**: The error string has no line numbers — just `"! Missing $ inserted"` with no location

Meanwhile, the `compilations` table already stores `log_text` (50KB of raw LaTeX log) which contains exact line numbers and file references, but fix-latex never uses it.

**Fixes 1-3 from the previous plan (preamble stripping, remove auto-recompile, isAutoCompiling state) are already implemented.** This plan addresses the core problem: making fix-latex actually work.

## Approach: Snippet-Based Targeted Fixing

Instead of full-document rewrite, extract only the lines around each error and fix those surgically.

### Layer 1: Enhance `parse-log.ts` — Extract Line Numbers + File Names

**File**: `apps/web/lib/latex/parse-log.ts`

Add `LatexErrorDetail` interface and `structuredErrors` to `ParsedLog`:

```typescript
export interface LatexErrorDetail {
  message: string;      // "Missing $ inserted"
  line?: number;        // 47 (from "l.47")
  file?: string;        // "chapters/results.tex" (from file stack)
  rawMessage: string;   // "! Missing $ inserted."
}

// Add to existing ParsedLog:
structuredErrors: LatexErrorDetail[];
```

Implementation:
- Track file stack via `(./filepath` and `)` parentheses in log
- After each `! error` line, scan next 4 lines for `l.NNN` pattern
- Record `{message, line, file}` in `structuredErrors`
- Keep existing `errors: string[]` unchanged for backward compatibility

### Layer 2: New Helper Module — `fix-latex-helpers.ts`

**New file**: `apps/web/lib/latex/fix-latex-helpers.ts`

Three helpers:

1. **`extractErrorContexts(content, errors)`** — For each error with a line number, extract ±5 lines around it. Merge overlapping windows.

2. **`buildTargetedUserMessage(contexts, errors)`** — Build focused AI prompt showing only the error snippets with line numbers:
   ```
   === Error: ! Missing $ inserted (line 47) ===
   42| Mean age was 45.3 years.
   ...
   47| Patients with BMI>30 kg/m2 had worse outcomes (p<0.001).
   ...
   52| The secondary analysis revealed:
   ```

3. **`parseFixResponse(response)` → `LineFix[]`** — Parse AI response lines matching `NN| fixed content`. Returns `null` if unparseable (triggers fallback).

4. **`applyLineFixes(original, fixes)`** — Replace specific lines by number in the original content.

### Layer 3: Rewrite `fix-latex/route.ts` — Dual-Path (Targeted + Fallback)

**File**: `apps/web/app/api/projects/[id]/sections/[phase]/fix-latex/route.ts`

1. Fetch latest failed compilation's `log_text` from `compilations` table
2. Parse with enhanced `parseLatexLog` → get structured errors with line numbers
3. Filter errors for this phase's chapter file (reverse-map via `PHASE_CHAPTER_MAP`)
4. If errors with line numbers found:
   - Extract context windows from section content body
   - Send focused prompt (only snippets) to Haiku with `max_tokens: 4096`
   - Parse response as `LineFix[]` and apply surgically
5. **Fallback** to current full-document approach if:
   - No compilation log in DB
   - Phase has no chapter file (phases 0, 1, 9, 10, 11)
   - No structured errors with line numbers
   - AI response doesn't parse as line fixes

### Layer 4: Export `PHASE_CHAPTER_MAP`

**File**: `apps/web/lib/latex/assemble.ts` — Add `export` to the existing `PHASE_CHAPTER_MAP` constant.

## Files to Modify/Create

| # | File | Change |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | `apps/web/lib/latex/parse-log.ts` | Add `LatexErrorDetail` interface, `structuredErrors` field, file stack tracking, line number extraction |
| 2 | `apps/web/lib/latex/fix-latex-helpers.ts` | **NEW** — context extraction, prompt building, response parsing, line replacement |
| 3 | `apps/web/app/api/projects/[id]/sections/[phase]/fix-latex/route.ts` | Rewrite with targeted fix (DB log fetch → parse → snippets → AI → apply) + fallback |
| 4 | `apps/web/lib/latex/assemble.ts` | Export `PHASE_CHAPTER_MAP` (add `export` keyword) |
| 5 | `apps/web/lib/latex/parse-log.test.ts` | Add tests for structured errors, file tracking, line numbers |
| 6 | `apps/web/lib/latex/fix-latex-helpers.test.ts` | **NEW** — tests for context extraction, response parsing, line replacement |

**No frontend changes needed** — fix-latex route fetches the log from DB itself.

## AI Prompt Design (Targeted Mode)

**System prompt** — focused on returning only changed lines:
```
You are a LaTeX syntax repair tool. Return ONLY the fixed lines.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
NN| fixed line content

Only include lines you changed. If no changes needed: NO_CHANGES_NEEDED
```

**User message** — only the error snippets with ±5 lines context and line numbers.

This reduces AI I/O from ~10,000 lines to ~50 lines (**~200x token savings**).

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No frontend changes**: fix-latex fetches `log_text` from DB — simpler, no prop threading
2. **CONTEXT_RADIUS = 5**: Assembly transforms rarely shift lines by more than 2-3; 5-line window covers it
3. **Fallback is the current full-document approach**: any failure in the targeted path falls through gracefully
4. **`max_tokens: 4096`** for targeted (vs 16000 for full-doc): much cheaper, since only returning changed lines
5. **Phases 0, 1, 9, 10, 11 always use fallback**: they inject into main.tex, line numbers don't map to section content

## Verification

1. `pnpm --filter apollo-web exec tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors
2. `pnpm --filter apollo-web test` — all tests pass (including new parse-log and fix-latex-helpers tests)
3. E2E: Trigger compile error (e.g., bare `>` in text) → click "Fix with AI" → verify only the specific lines are changed, no preamble, no content rewrite
4. Test fallback: Phase 1 (front matter) error → click "Fix with AI" → falls back to full-document approach gracefully
