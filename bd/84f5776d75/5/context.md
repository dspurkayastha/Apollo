Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Dashboard Design Refresh — Align with Landing Page

## Context

The landing page is finalised with a premium design language: cursor-tracking glows, zen easing, warm neutral palette, serif headings, and no hover-lift. The dashboard currently uses cold grey backgrounds (`#ECECEC`), generic shadcn tokens (`bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`), hover lift on project cards, and a basic collapsed sidebar (48px inline column). The user wants the dashboard to feel...

### Prompt 2

The collpased sidebar pill needs to have a frosted glass bg bar on the left edge, so as to not overlap over element s on the page, The transition animation between open and collapsed sidebar needs to be better. The collapsed pill sidebar should have the 'A' on the top, like the open sidebar has the Apollo branding ('A' is the collpased branding).

### Prompt 5

I dont want a full length rail, I want a pill only, with a pacer behind it in frosted glass deesign. I want a way to open the sidebar to full width from the pill as well, as we have one to close the full width sidebar to pill. The pill border needs to be more defined, have a better shadow on the frosted glass spacer nehind it. The Branding needs to be bigger on the open sidebar, and maintain the size of 'A' in closed pill state

### Prompt 6

center apollo brand on the open sidebar, increase font size to fit 75% width. Also in closed increase font size of A to fit 75% width. the close button on the open sidebar is clipped now and only half is visible.

### Prompt 7

### Prompt 9

ok, now back to landing. I want a dotgrid pattern for depth over the whole bg of the landing. none of the containers or elements should have harsh margins with it, and it should fade in outward with multiple stops at diff radii form the elements. Consider this an override of the soft lock

   - Task 1: Updated `glass-sidebar.tsx` — floating collapsed mode + brand font (`font-br...

### Prompt 17

I meant the full PLAN, in /docs/PLAN. gap analysis agaianst that. which sprints are done, which are midway, which are pending, what was achieved beyond plan. and a section on new suggestions based on the direction of the project . Think ultra hard

### Prompt 18

I agree with all your findings and suggestions as well. Craft a well thought out plan to achieve 100% on everything. Follow all UX and startegic suggestions which you made as well. Also the citataion management pipeline (starting from the first section with citations ie Intro through the end) doesnt work as intended. Intext citations as generated by AI are not being copiled in the database, deduped and verified, the verification pipeline itself works and pubmed and crossref quereies are working ...
